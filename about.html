        <p>
            Malware detection trends with outcomes: a basic report with a summary or a trend of malicious software detection, also showing the system and the outcome (cleaned or left alone) is a good starting point.
        </p>
        <p>
            Detect-only events from anti-virus tools: all anti-malware tools log the cases where malicious software was detected but not cleaned (for various reasons); such logged “leave-alones” have helped many organizations to avoid massive damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            All anti-virus protection failures: given that today’s malicious software is well equipped for fighting anti-virus tools, all crashes, protecting engine unloads, update failures, etc. must be logged and reviewed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Internal connections to known malware IP addresses: one can run this incredibly useful report using their logs (such firewall or other) and a public blacklist of IP addresses; such a simple approach can stop the organization from losing valuable data to malware operators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Least common malware types: along with other “Bottom 10” (as opposed to “Top 10”) reports, this presents a useful insight into unusual and thus possibly damaging malicious software in your organization.

            <b>Malware Detection</b>
            Among the more familiar forms of automated monitoring technologies, malware detection comprises mechanisms to identify and protect against harm from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, and other forms of malicious code. Malware detection and prevention technologies are widely available for servers, gateways, user workstations, and mobile devices, with some tools offering the capability to centrally monitor malware detection software installed on multiple systems or computers. Malware detection tools typically run continuously and provide automated updates of detection signatures or other reference information used to identify malicious code.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Warning</b>
            Many automated tools available for vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection, malware prevention, and event monitoring are signature-based, meaning they work by comparing observed network traffic, data flows, computing actions, and system responses to known patterns of malicious activity or misuse and produce alerts when such patterns are matched. Signature-based tools can be prone to false positives (traffic or behavior that triggers an alert but is not actually an occurrence of the event corresponding to the signature), so agencies implementing these tools typically cannot rely on automation alone but must also require manual checks and verifications of the monitoring data generated by the tools.
